# POC of JWT authorization in Spring boot using PostgreSQL

This POC is a Spring Boot application which uses JJWT library to implement JWT Authentication.

The demo implements Spring Security with JPA using PostgreSQL. (Users are retrieved from the database. Which can be used for user registration as well.)

Future Improvements:

- Try to implement JWT using nimbus JWT library.
